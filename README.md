Simple web application used as a client for a [REST API](https://github.com/lvrnjak1/MyBlogServer). This was a demonstrative app developed to showcase the abilities of GraphQL as well as some differences to the REST API approach in my bachelor's disertation paper. To compare I have developed an equivalent [GraphQL client](https://github.com/lvrnjak1/MyBlogAppGraphQL).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The app is available at: [My Blog App](https://lvrnjak-my-blog-app-rest.herokuapp.com/)
